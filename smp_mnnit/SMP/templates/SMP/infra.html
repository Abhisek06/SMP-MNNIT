      <p>Infrastructure doesn't define the campus. The word campus holds meaning just because of students.

But you might get trapped in a bad friendship as well and you may indulge in a lot of unwanted activities. Better is to choose a bright friend than to choose a dampened future. The one most important line is - “ Choose your seniors wisely.” Listen to everyone's opinion but follow only one good senior who will encourage you always and tell you about pros and cons of everything with his own experience.Seniors are very supportive towards their juniors. They help their juniors for their studies , and always take extra classes for juniors. A lot of things can be learned from the seniors. You might get disappointed with the infrastructure, 60s buildings, untrained lab instructors but you'd be highly overwhelmed with the nature of few faculty members as well as PhD scholars.Campus Area is not so big but not small also, contains all the requisite facilities.

      <p>Life at MNNIT - It will be a roller coaster ride. Sometimes, you will be too happy with the events and sometimes, you may get disappointed with the managers. Sometimes, you'll be too happy because of your colleagues and sometimes, even being a part of the group might feel boring and uninteresting. Sometimes,you will be happy to learn new things and sometimes, you'll curse the old concept of rote learning in a few subjects to score marks. Some will give you extra marks and some will give less than what you deserve. Sometimes,you will be happy for your achievements in Avishkar and you might get disappointed for your loss as well. But after all, you'll learn a new life. You will learn to tackle pressure. You'll learn to bring out the best of you. You'll learn professionalism. You'll get some good attributes from some respected seniors. You'll get a lot of experiences. You'll get a friend who will always be there to listen to you. You will get to go through all these things which will ultimately be based on your decisions.
