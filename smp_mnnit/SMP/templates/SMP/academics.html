        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Electronics and Communication Engineering</h2>
       <p style="color: white;">Electronics and Communication Engineering is a branch of Engineering which has developed a lot over the past few years. If diving deep into the working of Transistors and knowing more about the semiconductors entice you then Electronics and Communication Engineering is surely your cup of tea. 
      </p>
       <h4><strong>What college has to offer?</strong></h4>
      <p style="color: white;">Again till 4th Semester most of the courses of Electronics and Communication Engineering is very similar to that of Electrical Engineering but then after the 4th Semester you will have to dive deep into the core subjects of Electronics like the VLSI. The labs of ECE department are also well maintained.

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Mechanical & Production and Industrial Engineering</h2>
        <p style="color: white;">Have you ever thought “why f1 cars are so fast?”, “How robots do what they do?”, “how turbine engines are designed?”, “and how F-35 maneuver VTOL?” Mechanical engineering holds the key for all of your answers. This branch gives you grounding for concepts of machines, manufacturing process, automation and control, vehicle and rotor dynamics. While providing exposure to its sub discipline of mechatronics and robotics. From revving of koenigsegg regera to the aerodynamic magnificence of Boeing V-22 osprey the outcome of this engineering discipline will shock you to the core. 
        </p>
        <span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">
        <p style="color: white;">Broadly speaking Mechanical engineering is science of machines. You will learn fundamentals of design and analysis of a mechanical component. Under course offered by this branch you will develop an understanding of thermodynamics, heat transfer, fluid mechanics and dynamics, solid mechanics, strength of materials, kinematics, multibody dynamics, manufacturing processes and practices, control systems and so on. And believe me it is just the tip of iceberg what lies beyond is concept of vehicle, aero and rotor dynamics, Computer aided engineering and list goes on.
        </p>
        <p style="color: white;">Note: Production and industrial engineering is subset of mechanical engineering where you will acquire knowledge of production processes developed and maintained by different genre of industries.
        </p>
        <h4><strong>What college has to offer?</strong></h4>
        <p style="color: white;">Starting from the diverse alumni community, board of experienced professors, various technical clubs and mechanical laboratories of MNNIT will leave no stone unturned in shaping your conscious towards a more positive outlook towards a technical problem. Technical club like SAE will engage you in inter collegiate competitions where you can build your own vehicle by implying the classroom knowledge in practical situation. You will also find multiple students engaged and excelled in various competitive exams like GRE, GATE, ESE, CAT etc. who are eager to provide a support group for you if you wish for the same.
        </p>
        <p style="color: white;">MED of MNNIT has following laboratories: Thermal Engineering Laboratories, Production and Industrial Engineering Laboratories, Design Engineering  Labs, Mechanical Engineering Workshop, Heat engine laboratory etc.

          <li>Academics cannot be neglected by you at any cost because everything which will happen with you in college will depend upon your pointer only. Here at MNNIT Allahabad we have absolute grading system in which certain grades are accorded to the students on the basis of marks obtained out of 100. And after calculating your grades in all the subjects for that semester you will be given a SPI (Semester Performance Index).</li>
          <li>As you will move onto the next semesters the SPI’s of the previous semesters will help in calculating your CPI (Cumulative Performance Index).          </li>
          <li>There will be two exams per semester to evaluate the depth up to which a student has learnt the subject – the midsemester examination and the end semester examination. </li>
          <li>The mid-semester examination will be of 20 marks and the end semester examination will be of 60 marks. The rest 20 marks will be in the hands of the respective subject professors and will be given keeping in view your performance throughout the semester in that subject, marks scored in quizzes, assignments and tutorials solved and attendance.</li>
          <li><strong>Important- </strong><em>MNNIT ALLAHABAD has a strict policy of maintaining at least 75 percent attendance in all the subjects failing which you would be debarred from appearing in the end semester examination. Thus, take attendance very seriously and try to attend classes with full zeal and enthusiasm.
          </em></MNNIT> </li>
          <li><strong> Merit Cum Scholarship-</strong><em>It is a scholarship amount of ₹20,000 which is given to the top 5 students of every branch at MNNIT Allahabad of each year based on the performance up to the previous year. The scholarship is awarded only if the student qualifies in the top 5 of his/her branch and is also not receiving scholarship of any kind. Merit Cum Scholarship is given by the Dean Student Welfare Office, MNNIT Allahabad.  </em> </li>
