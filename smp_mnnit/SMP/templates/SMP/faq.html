            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Do I need to fear seniors from being ragged?</h2>
            <p class="life">This is one of the most common questions but it is absolutely a NO. You can find seniors more friendly than you usually expect. They give you treats. They give you better advice, either it be in academics or about your passion.

           <p class="life">One of the ways, college helps one financially is by providing scholarship to the students who perform well in academics. <span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">  If you will keep working hard and will put genuine efforts, then even college steps forward to honor your hard work and determination to support you financially. There are different types of scholarships provided by college for students coming from somewhat weak financial background to meet their day to day needs in college as well as helping them in terms of fees.
